- 👋 Hi, I’m Jaxon Price, @jprice87 on Github.

- 🎓 I am student at the University of Arkansas. I am working towards a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in Philosophy and Mathematics.

- 👀 I’m interested in figuring out the best ways that humans and computers can co-exist.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning web and app development/design skills and philosophy in order to find new ways in which software can be more ethical.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any type of software that has heavy social/political implications in order to best use my cross-diciplinary skills.

- 📫 How to reach me: Email me anytime at jaxonprice2@gmail.com
